# Learning Git

this project uses _git_ as a version control system, along with the [GitHub](https://github.com/) website for hosting the code and multiple other features  

if you want a good understanding of git, suggest to read the first 3 chapters of [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2):  
  * the following sections could be skipped: _1.5, 1.6, 2.6, 2.7, 3.5, 3.6_  
  * the book is a recommended resource by the git community but many other tutorials exist, so feel free to use other 'intro to git/github' videos/websites  

a short presentation that summaries the book's content can be found [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse403/13au/lectures/git.ppt.pdf)   

a presentation by SLAC that explains git, github, git workflow, etc can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AXcH17xDfum4mZsdV5lfjn_mvSMp2ye796xrVuSM3w8/edit#slide=id.gf4dca9affc_0_7)  
  
a git commands cheat-sheet can be found here [here](https://www.jrebel.com/system/files/git-cheat-sheet.pdf) (**link will start download of pdf cheat sheet)    

(if you plan on developing the library) read about GitHub's 'Pull Request' feature here [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)  

for commit messages, we can try to follow the PyDM guidelines: https://slaclab.github.io/pydm/development/development.html#commit-guidelines
